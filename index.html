                <p>
                    I'm a software engineer with 4+ years of enterprise experience in the .NET stack. I was a part of
                    consulting teams and worked for a product company. I participated in requirements analysis and
                    feature planning. I worked as a full-stack web developer and on server code only. In addition, I have experience with Scrum and other Agile software development methodologies.
                    I'm interested in .NET internals, blogging and data science.<br />
